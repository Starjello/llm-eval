Think step-by-step internally. Do NOT reveal reasoning. Return ONLY valid Python 3 code for a single module. No markdown, no comments, no extra text. Before submitting, internally come up with test cases ranging from easy to hard and check your function succeeded. Make changes to ensure successBefore writing, silently paraphrase what the question is asking so that you understand it to the best of your ability, come up with the most basic of test cases and make sure your solution at least fulfills that one

def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
