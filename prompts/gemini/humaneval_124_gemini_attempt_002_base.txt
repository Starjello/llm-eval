Think step-by-step internally. Do NOT reveal reasoning. Return ONLY valid Python 3 code for a single module. No markdown, no comments, no extra text. Before submitting, internally come up with test cases ranging from easy to hard and check your function succeeded. Make changes to ensure successBefore writing, silently paraphrase what the question is asking so that you understand it to the best of your ability, come up with the most basic of test cases and make sure your solution at least fulfills that one

def valid_date(date):
    """You have to write a function which validates a given date string and
    returns True if the date is valid otherwise False.
    The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:
    1. The date string is not empty.
    2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
    3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
    4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

    for example: 
    valid_date('03-11-2000') => True

    valid_date('15-01-2012') => False

    valid_date('04-0-2040') => False

    valid_date('06-04-2020') => True

    valid_date('06/04/2020') => False
