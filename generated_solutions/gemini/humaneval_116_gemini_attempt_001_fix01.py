    # suggests a simple numerical sort for all-negative arrays.

    # 3 (11) -> 2 ones

    # Given the examples, it seems the intent is a simple numerical sort,

    # However, the problem description explicitly states "sort them according to
    # number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    # For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value."

    # Let's assume the description is primary and the examples are either
    # insufficient or misleading for the "number of ones" part.
    # The negative number example is a special case.

    # For non-negative numbers, apply the custom sorting logic.
    # This also handles mixed arrays if the problem implies only non-negative
    # elements should be sorted by bit count, and negative elements are just numerically sorted.
    # However, the problem states "Given an array of non-negative integers".
    # The presence of the negative example makes it ambiguous.
    # Let's stick to the most literal interpretation: if *all* are negative, sort numerically.
    # Otherwise, if there are non-negative numbers, apply the bit count sort.
    # This implies that if there's a mix (e.g., [-1, 0, 1]), the bit count sort should apply to 0 and 1.
    # But the problem says "array of non-negative integers".
    # The most robust interpretation that satisfies the negative example and the description for non-negatives:
    # If all elements are negative, sort numerically.
    # Otherwise, sort based on (number of ones, decimal value) for all elements.
    # This means negative numbers would also be sorted by their bit count if they are mixed with non-negatives.
    # For negative numbers, `bin(x)` gives `'-0b...'`. We need `bin(abs(x))` for bit count.
    # Or, more simply, `x.bit_count()` for Python 3.10+ or `bin(x).count('1')` for positive `x`.
    # For negative `x`, `bin(x)` gives two's complement representation for `x` if `x` is a small integer.
    # E.g., `bin(-1)` is `'-0b1'`. `bin(-2)` is `'-0b10'`.
    # The problem implies "number of ones in their binary representation" for the *absolute value* or magnitude
    # when dealing with negative numbers, or it's simply not meant to apply to negative numbers.
    # Given the "non-negative integers" in the description, the negative example is an outlier.

    # Let's assume the "non-negative integers" in the description is the primary constraint
    # and the negative example is a special case for *only* negative numbers.
    # If the array contains *any* non-negative numbers, then the bit count sorting applies.
    # This means the `all(x < 0 for x in arr)` check is correct for the special case.
    # For all other cases (including mixed positive/negative, or all positive),
    # we apply the bit count sort.

    # For negative numbers, `bin(x)` gives `'-0b...'`. `x.bit_count()` works for positive integers.
    # For negative integers, `(-x).bit_count()` would be the number of ones in the absolute value.
    # Let's use `x.bit_count()` for Python 3.10+. If not available, `bin(x).count('1')` for positive.
    # For negative numbers, `bin(x)` gives `'-0b101'` for `-5`. `count('1')` would be 2.
    # This seems to be the most straightforward interpretation.

            # If it means the number of ones in the two's complement representation,
            # it depends on the bit width.
            # If it means the number of ones in the absolute value, then:
            return abs(n).bit_count()
            # return bin(abs(n)).count('1')

    # The examples for non-negative numbers ([1, 5, 2, 3, 4] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    # are still problematic if we strictly follow "number of ones".

    # (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5)
    # Result: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
    # This does NOT match the example `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

    # This implies that for non-negative numbers, the sorting is *just* numerical,
    # and the "number of ones" rule is either misstated or applies to a different set of inputs.
    # Given the provided examples, the simplest solution that passes them is:
    # if all negative, sort numerically.
    # otherwise, sort numerically.

    # This contradicts the description "sort them according to number of ones".
    # The only way to reconcile the description with the examples is if the examples
    # happen to have the same order when sorted by bit count and then by value, as when sorted numerically.
    # Let's check:
    # [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]
    # (1,1), (5,2), (2,1), (3,2), (4,1)  <- (value, bit_count)
    # Sorted by (bit_count, value):
    # (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (3,2), (5,2)
    # Result: [1
